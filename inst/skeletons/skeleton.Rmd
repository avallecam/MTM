## Reminder

For this, you should generally run the code, examine the results, and then answer the questions individually or amongst a small group.

Some questions entail changing or filling in missing function arguments. These are indicated with `TODO("Explanatory message.")` placeholders.

In some places, we suggest relevant functions by "hint: ?FUNCTION". At the console, you can invoke `?FUNCTION` -- to see the documentation -- or `FUNCTION` (no parentheses) -- to see the function body. However, these capabilities aren't available smoothly in `learnr` exercise blocks.

There are some sections marked with *ASIDE*; do _not_ bother with these until you have finished all other material in the exercise. They are intended as extensions if you finish the core exercise in the allotted time or wish to revisit the material later.

For all exercise blocks, in addition to basic R libraries and the MTM package, you will also be able to use definitions from `r paste0(.otherpackages, collapse = ", ")`.

## Warmup

This material is written using the `igraph` library. There are other libraries that provide the same basic functionality, but via different approaches, e.g. `networkx`

### Exercise A

The igraph library has several functions to create common network structures, including both deterministic ones (**e.g.** fully connected graphs) and probabilistic generators (**e.g.** Erdos-Renyi random graphs).

In `igraph`, the general convention is that the deterministic functions start with `make_...`, and the probabilistic generators start with `sample_...`. You can see a list of the options by `??igraph::make_` and `??igraph::sample_`.


```{r intro_networks, exercise=TRUE}
ig10 <- make_full_graph(n = 10)
ig30 <- make_full_graph(n = 30)
ig10layout <- layout_with_graphopt(ig10)
ig30layout <- layout_with_graphopt(ig30)
plot(ig10, layout = ig10layout); print(ig10)
plot(ig30, layout = ig30layout); print(ig30)

ig10gnp <- sample_gnp(10, 0.2)
ig30gnp <- sample_gnp(30, 0.2)
plot(ig10gnp, layout = ig10layout); print(ig10gnp)
plot(ig30gnp, layout = ig30layout); print(ig30gnp)
```

```{r intro_networks_A_quiz}
quiz(
  question_freeresponse(
    "Describe the graphs these functions create.",
    "Some reply."
  )
)
```

### ASIDE

Note that by default, plotting an igraph object gives a different layout each time

```{r intro_networks_aside, exercise=TRUE}
plot(ig10); plot(ig10) # compare these two
#' To get the same plot, you can generate a layout for a graph (as above)
plot(ig10, layout = ig10layout); plot(ig10, layout = ig10layout) # compare these two 
#' this can be useful for comparing across graphs as well
plot(ig10, layout = ig10layout); plot(ig10gnp, layout = ig10layout)

```

### Exercise 

*Here's a simple exercise with an empty code chunk provided for entering the answer.*

Write the R code required to add two plus two:

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}

```

### Exercise with Code

*Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.*

Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it:

```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
add <- function() {
  
}
```

## SIR on a Network, Part 1

Now that we have some familiarity with how `igraph` works for representing networks, we can turn our attention to using those representations to model infectious disease dynamics.

Recalling the earlier course materials defining _variables_ and _parameters_, as well as the Network session materials describing the Reed-Frost *SIR* model:

What are the _variables_ and _parameters_ in the Reed-Frost model? What is the `network_build` function (from `MTM` package) doing to capture those?

```{r parti_var_and_par_quiz}
quiz(
  question_freeresponse(
    "Which *parameters* are present?",
    "_N_, the size of the population & _p_, the probability of transmission from infectious individuals during a time step."
  ),
  question_freeresponse(
    "Which *variables* are present?",
    "_S_, the susceptibles & _I_, the infectious; _R_ is also present in a definition sense, though no individuals in the population are in _R_ initially."
  )
)
```

HINT: Use this block to examine that function, by printing the function body or by examining the function arguments.

```{r p1_network_build, exercise = TRUE}
network_build
```


#' A:
#' variables: S & I (no R yet)
#' parameters: N (no p)


## SIR on a Network, Version 2

## SIR on a Network, Version 3

### Exercise with Hint

*Here's an exercise where the chunk is pre-evaulated via the `exercise.eval` option (so the user can see the default output we'd like them to customize). We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*

Modify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5:

```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
mtcars
```

```{r print-limit-hint}
head(mtcars)
```

### Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?",
    answer("base"),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("utils", correct = TRUE),
    answer("codetools")
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```
