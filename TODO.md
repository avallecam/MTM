need to determine a naming convention that will work across sessions
require: useful function names (concise, indicative of use, etc), that ALSO
   enable quick lookup by session
desire: stable against future revisions to course schedule (e.g. reordering
   sessions); ideally prefix based to enable `?MTM::SESSION_` to suggest

Preliminary solution: short, "nickname" prefix by session
Using `network_` for network session functions
